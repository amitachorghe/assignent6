    <h2>What's the problem?</h2>
    <hr />

    <br />
    <p>
      A problem is a situation preventing something from being achieved. The
      word comes from a Greek word meaning an "obstacle" (something that is
      in<br />
      your way). Someone who has a problem must find a way of solving it. The
      means of solving a problem is called a "solution". Problems are the<br />
      player's main interaction with their Miis. There are five types of
      problems a Mii can have: normal, friendship-related, love-related,<br />
      sadness, and playful. They are represented by black, orange, pink, blue,
      and green icons respectively. When the player goes into an apartment
      with<br />
      a problem, there will be different music for each problem. New events and
      locations will be unlocked based on how many problems they have solved.<br />
      These are the most common type of problems, ranging from a Mii being
      hungry to wanting their age to be changed. Most of them can be solved
      by<br />
      giving a Mii items they request. If the player taps the gift icon when the
      Mii wants something, the game will show the category of what they want.
      If<br />
      the Mii has a non-item related problem, the game will show the food
      category. These are represented by a black icon with a scribble on the<br />
      Mii's window. Every person has problems: even the wealthiest individual on
      the globe has challenges in life. There are times when problems feel<br />
      overwhelming and like you might not be able to get past them. But by
      taking responsibility for your problems and setting a path to correct
      them<br />
      in a constructive way, you can deal with any problems that come your
      way.<br />
      Stay as calm as possible. It is common to overreact when you face a
      problem, but this can cause you to make bad decisions.[1] Before you
      begin<br />
      tackling your problems, get in control of your emotions, which may help
      you stay calm and more effectively deal with whatever you’re facing.
      Take<br />
      a few deep breaths and repeat to yourself “let” when you inhale and “go”
      when you exhale. This can help control your heart rate and allow you to<br />
      relax.[2] Repeat to yourself “I can get through this. It’s challenging,
      but I can find a solution.”<br />
      Accept responsibility for the problem. Consciously acknowledge the problem
      and then accept responsibility for your part in it.[3] This can allow
      you<br />
      to begin actively and constructively dealing with any problem.[4] Write
      down or list the problems and their causes. This can help you more
      readily<br />
      visualize, accept, and even deal with a problem. For example, if you
      missed a mortgage payment, accept that you bear some, if not all,<br />
      responsibility for this.[5] Likewise, if you have bad grades, acknowledge
      the role that you played in getting those bad grades.<br />

      Evaluate situations before you respond. If you find yourself dealing with
      a problem and you are not sure what or who caused it, take a moment to<br>
      think before you react. It’s easy to blame someone else for problems,
      especially when you feel challenged or overwhelmed, but blaming others is<br>
      counterproductive and may even cause further issues.[6] Take a moment to
      determine if the problem was caused by external factors (other people or<br>
      things beyond your control), internal factors (something you did or failed
      to do), or a mixture of the two. External factors. If someone hits your<br>
      car while it is parked in a parking lot, then this would be an example of
      a problem caused by external factors. You did not cause the accident and<br>
      there was nothing you could have done to prevent it. Internal factors. If
      you arrive late to work because you hit the snooze button on your alarm<br>
      too many times, then this would be an example of an internal factor. In
      this situation, it would be important to acknowledge your role in arriving<br>
      late to work so that you can avoid making the same mistake in the future.
      Mixture. If your group gets a poor grade on a group presentation, then<br>
      chances are that there are things that all of you could have done better,
      not just one person. Try to identify your role in the situation and take<br>
      responsibility for it.
